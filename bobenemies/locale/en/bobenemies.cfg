bob-basic-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=240,180,20]Generates Obstacles. [/color][color=230,230,20]Slowing Acid.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Explosion.[/color][/font]\n\nThese creatures are the dominant lifeform on Nauvis. They exhibit several distinct forms, but all are the same species.\n\nThe [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]spitter and worm[/color][/font] varieties attack with sticky and corrosive bile, aiming to slow their targets and digest them on the spot. Meanwhile, the [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]biters[/color][/font] will attempt to box their targets in, carving into pieces with their powerful forelegs and jaws, while also giving time for the bile to do its work.\n\nAgainst a well-armored target, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]the bile these creatures use is their most threatening aspect.[/color][/font] The bile used by worms and spitters of this breed has a slightly different composition depending on their size, and these can work together to [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]compound their slowing effects[/color][/font]. If a vehicle is forced to stop while being affected in such a way, it may be next to impossible to get it moving again.
bob-piercing-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=40,200,200]Damage Reaction: Non-Electric, Non-Acid.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Explosion, Fire, Physical, Pierce.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Acid, Electric, Laser, Poison.[/color][/font]\n\nThis breed of enemy forgoes any form of digestive bile in their ranged attacks in favor of launching [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]armor-piercing barbs[/color][/font] at high speeds. Though they lack the damage-over-time of some other breeds, these barbs will require good mobility in order to evade them. However, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]their projectiles will not be able to pass over walls[/color][/font].\n\nThese enemies are particularly [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]resistant to kinetic impacts[/color][/font] of all kinds, have high regenerations, and exhibit [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]bursts of speed when attacked[/color][/font], on top of their already fast movement. These traits mean that their [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]biters are far more dangerous[/color][/font] than those of other breeds. [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Electricity will not trigger their rage[/color][/font].
bob-electric-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=255,120,40]Anti-Air Threat. [/color][color=230,230,20]Slowing Acid. [/color][color=40,200,200]Damage Reaction: Electric. [/color][color=180,60,230]Friendly Fire.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Electric, Laser.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Electric, Fire, Poison.[/color][/font]\n\nUtilizing electrical discharges in their attacks allows biters of this breed to [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]strike targets directly behind walls[/color][/font]. The bile that electric spitters and worms employ in their ranged attacks also uses electricity to inflict paralysis, though the effect is short-lived. Noteably, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]enemies of other breeds are also susceptible to this effect[/color][/font], as are flying objects that would normally ignore pools of acid on the ground.\n\nBeing struck by electricity will cause biters and spitters of this breed to [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]speed up significantly[/color][/font], and [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]their own pools of electrically-charged bile can trigger their rage[/color][/font].
bob-acid-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Damage Over Time. [/color][color=40,200,200]Damage Reaction: Impact. [/color][color=70,130,220]Post-Death Attack.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Acid, Poison.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Electric.[/color][/font]\n\nThe acidic bile of these enemies has been reformulated for maximum corrosiveness and persistence, at the cost of its slowing ability. It will stick to any foe that walks or drives over it, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]not only inflicting immediate damage, but also damage over time[/color][/font]. It is also capable of inflicting [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]more damage against structures[/color][/font] than other similar kinds of acid. [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]Enemies may also explode into a spray of acid upon death, or release acid when impacted by a large object[/color][/font].
bob-explosive-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=255,120,40]Anti-Air Threat. [/color][color=70,130,220]Post-Death Attack.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Acid, Explosion.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Electric, Fire, Laser.[/color][/font]\n\nThe explosive breed relies on instantaneous damage over a wide area in lieu of slower methods like digestive bile. Their attacks are not as haphazard as they seem, however, as they will be shaped to not target allies. Fortunately, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]the wider circle of explosive damage they inflict also does not seem to target non-combat infrastructure[/color][/font].\n\nDespite not having a digestive or slowing effect, the pools their attacks leave on the grouns should still be avoided. These pools leech organic compounds from the ground beneath them for processing into more explosives. Thus, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]the pools are capable of exploding again after a delay, and may do this multiple times[/color][/font]. Biters and spitters of this breed may also explode on death.
bob-poison-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Damage Over Time. [/color][color=255,120,40]Anti-Air Threat. [/color][color=60,200,60]Healing Effect. [/color][color=40,200,200]Damage Reaction.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Acid, Poison.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Fire[/color][/font]\n\nRather than standard chemical toxins, the poison utilized by enemies of this breed is a blend of enzymes produced by free-floating cells, customized to attack whatever material they come into contact with. The cells are deployed through the creatures' saliva, or in clouds of gas around their bodies, and are also capable of [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]mending the wounds of allied creatures[/color][/font].\n\nThese enemies inflict [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]moderate amounts of damage over time across a wide area[/color][/font], but their most dangerous attribute is their healing ability, especially in combination with other enemy breeds.
bob-fire-enemy=[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Damage Over Time. [/color][color=255,120,40]Anti-Air Threat. [/color][color=180,60,230]Friendly Fire.[/color][/font]\n\n[font=default-semibold][color=200,60,60]Strong to: Explosion, Fire, Laser.[/color][/font]\n[font=default-semibold][color=60,200,60]Weak to: Impact, Physical, Pierce.[/color][/font]\n\nAttacks from all creatures of this breed start fires. These fires are fueled by chemicals that are both combustible and highly acidic, ensuring that [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]even fully fireproof structures are not immune[/color][/font]. While initially weak, [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]they grow in intensity as more fuel is added by repeated attacks[/color][/font], eventually becoming the most destructive form of attack against defensive structures that any breed of hostile creature on Nauvis possesses. A blaze may also [font=default-semibold][color=255,230,192]spread a small distance[/color][/font] from its origin point.
