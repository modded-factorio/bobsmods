Version: 1.3.0
Date: ???
  Info:
    - Update for Factorio 2.0 #189
  Features:
    - Enemies have been fleshed out into 7 complete factions, each with 8 tiers of mobs. Detailed information on each faction is available in the Factoriopedia.
    - The basic faction emphasizes acid with slowing effects, and later on will generate extra obstacles that can't easily be removed by robots.
    - The piercing faction features ranged attacks that use high-speed projectiles, and will speed up when damaged.
    - The electric faction uses paralyzing acid that will slow you down greatly, but only briefly. Electricity speeds them up, but some of their attacks inflict friendly fire.
    - The explosive faction is able to create a minefield with attacks that may randomly explode more than once.
    - The acid faction uses long-lived acid to inflict potent damage over time and spews acid upon death.
    - The poison faction generates clouds of smoke that follow them around, damaging enemies and healing allies.
    - The fire faction's damage is initially relatively low, but grows over time as more fuel is added to the blazes they set.
    - A new base spawning system has been implemented, which will cause nearby bases to share the same faction, creating distinct territories.
    - Enemies bases may spawn with quality boosts. This may be disabled in Mod Settings.
