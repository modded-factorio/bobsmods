  "description": "Re-adds Alien artifacts to the game.\nAdds 6 different coloured versions of artifacts to the game, each based on a different damage type.\nAdds small versions of artifacts dropped by biters and spitters.\nAdds six new breeds of enemies to the game, in addition to the original vanilla type.\nAll seven breeds have a full eight tiers of worms, biters, and spitters.\nEnemy bases will initially focus on a single breed, before eventually diversifying into having two or three together.\nNearby bases will tend to belong to the same breed, creating territories.\nEnemies may have quality boosts."
