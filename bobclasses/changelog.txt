  Changes:
    - Added function get_classes() to remote interface.

    - Added class_name to class data, so the new class name can be passed on to remote calls.
    - Interact with the Minime mod, so that you can switch to another character skin.
    - Interact directly with the Jetpack mod if Minime is not active. This way, you can still swtich between the flying/non-flying versions of a character.
    - Call Minime from on_entity_died, before removing the association of character and player. This way, Minime can store what player was associated with the character's corpse.

    - If minime was asked to pick a new character version, and it returned nil, use a fallback.
